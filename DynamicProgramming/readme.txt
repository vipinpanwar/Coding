****************************Dynamic Programming********************************

1. It is a enhanced recursion
2. We always have choice like , below f1 calling itseld with two different choice chances are 
   here for dp.
3. mostly ask for optimal.

                       f1
                    f1     f1

4. As parent of dp is recusrion so we have two things
 a.) base condition
 b.) choice diagram

 For base condition think of smallest **valid condition .
