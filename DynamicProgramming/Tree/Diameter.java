/**
 *  Problem : Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. 
 * The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree.
 *  This path may or may not pass through the root.
 *
 *Example:
 *Given a binary tree
 *         1
 *        / \
 *        2   3
 *       / \     
 *      4   5    
 *Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
 * 
 * Solution : For this we can calculate the height of left part and right part,
 *          Now for every node we have two things 
 *      1.) pass the max number of (node) + 1 to its parent
 *      2.) Second thing  if diameter pass through this node, then save it to the ans as , ans = max(ans , (leftnodes + right_nodes) +1);
 * 
 *            
 *
