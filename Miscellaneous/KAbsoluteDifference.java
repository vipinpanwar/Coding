/**
 *  Problem : We are given an array of size n containing positive integers.
 *  The absolute difference between values at indices i and j is |a[i] â€“ a[j]|.
 *  There are n*(n-1)/2 such pairs and we are asked to print the kth (1 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2) 
 *  smallest absolute difference among all these pairs.
 * 
 *  example : Input  : a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
 *        k = 3
 *      Output : 1
 *       The possible absolute differences are :
 *       {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1}. or { 1 , 1 , 1 ,2 ,2 ,3}
 * 
 * Soln L ::  For worst case approach we can count the absolute difference inside one 
 *            vector or array let say range of element is 1 to 10^6 then we can create one 
 *            array count[10e^6] and we count the diff to this count array count[arr[i]-arr[i-1]]++;
 * 
 *            once count array is done we have do the running sum on count array and if sum > k then return i
 *             else -1;
